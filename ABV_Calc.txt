Guys, what is the best website to get accurate ABV calculations from or is there a correct mathematical formula that should be used? I get different abv's from different website calculators.

ABV = (OG - FG) * 131.25

Sg-fg multiplied by
0.129 if the gravity diff is between 26.2 and 36
0.130 if the gravity diff is between 36.1 and 46.5
0.131 if the gravity diff is between 46.6 and 57.1

E.g
Sg = 1048
Fg = 1008
48-8 = 40 x 0.130 = 5.2%
This is the Revenue calculation
